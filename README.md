<h1>📊 Dataset Description :</h1>

The dataset comprises customer support interactions, enabling the training and evaluation of AI models for tasks such as conversation summarization, action extraction, and resolution recommendation. The dataset is too small that it's hard to provide a lot of information except some visual...

<h1>🛠️ Project Workflow :</h1>

<h2>1️⃣ Data Analysis & Preprocessing :</h2>

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure and content of customer support interactions.


<h2>3️⃣ Evaluation & Metrics :</h2>

- **Performance Metrics**: Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model effectiveness.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzing true vs. predicted values to understand model performance.
- **Error Analysis**: Identifying and interpreting patterns in misclassified instances.
